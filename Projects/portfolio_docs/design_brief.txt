   HOMEPAGE: 

	Avatar
	I’m Mariana—good to e-meet you! I am a finance technology professional experienced in strategy consulting, data analysis, and finance process improvement. 

   ABOUT ME:

	Using data to create recommendations and helping companies launch new products or services, scale and expand internationally, and become more efficient motivates me. I also 	love being wrong and learning new things (right now, my focus is on learning web development).

	A Mexico City native where I studied public policy, I am always interested in discussing urban policy and finding good tacos. When not working or online, you can find me 	lifting weights, reading, or building LEGO.

	I worked as a paramedic for many years, so I am good at working with limited resources while under pressure. If you’re interested in working with me (or want taco 		recommendations!), reach out [email link].

   WORK:

	I have experience in data analysis and financial modeling as well as various project management methodologies and tools. Even before this global health event, I have worked 	from home with distributed and cross-functional teams all over the world. I speak fluent Spanish and have intermediate knowledge of Portuguese, French, and German.

E) I looked at the following portfolio examples:
	• http://www.kathrynmcclintock.com  I like that this website is very straightforward and the author puts her picture at the beginning. It is also not dynamic or has any 	weird navigation effects, which I appreciate. The header is her logo in yellow. Main is the body with information. Footer are the links/icons to her social media at the 	bottom.
	• https://www.behance.net/IgnacioMacri - This portfolio is a great use of graphics and images. I love the color, simplicity and symmetry in it. I also appreciate that it is 	easy to contact its author. It is a bit confusing to click on the main logo because it only reloads the page—maybe I would have got rid of that link at least in the 		homepage. The header is the black banner at the top. Main is the body with the different images/posters with the author’s work. Footer is not used.
	• http://www.drewtempleton.com - This was my favorite portfolio. The author uses logos, images, and even emojis in a way that is easy to understand and it is very easy to 	navigate. I also appreciate that the author not only showcases his work but it also shows some of his passions outside of work. The downside is that his subpages are pop-	ups, so that is not the best navigation experience if you use a pop-up blocker and makes the website seem broken. The header is the logo at the top. The main are the 		pictures with links to the subpages. The author does not use a footer.
