<p> 
    Welcome to my hobby website. Indoor rowing is the hobby I want to share with you. Indoor rowing is 
    a cardio workout that you perform using a rowing machine, which is also called an "erg". 
    That is all you need for this hobby, no special shoes, no special clothes, just a rowing machine and 
    your body. I really enjoy this hobby because I can do it at any time, it keeps me in shape, and there 
    is a large community of rowers around the world, so it is easy to connect with other people who 
    enjoy it.
</p>

<h2>
    What is a rowing machine?
</h2>

<p>An erg or rowing machine is a simple machine that works with resistance and a chain. In a way, it is 
    very similar to a bicycle: the erg is fully powered by the user and it is not connected to a source
    of power, like an electrical outlet. 
</p>
<p>
    First, let's take a look at the erg and its different parts: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Monitor</li> 
        <li>Flywheel</li> 
        <li>Damper</li>
        <li>Seat</li>
    </ul>

<p class="aligncenter">
    <img src="fullerg.jpg" width="500" height="350" alt="This is an erg."> 
</p>

<p> 
    The monitor is the "brains" of the machine. It is a battery powered display that measures the power 
    in watts of your stroke (every time you pull the handle in the rowing motion), it also measures the 
    calories you burn, the number of strokes per minute, and gives you estimates on other metrics. 
</p>
<p 
class="aligncenter"> <img src="monitor.jpg" width="300" height="350" alt="This is the monitor.">
</p>

<p>
    The flywheel is what generates the resistance on the erg. In this machine, the resistance is air-based 
    but in other ergs it can be water-based, magnetic, or hydraulic. However, the air flywheel is the one 
    that feels the most like if you were actually rowing a boat in the water, which is why most rowers prefer 
    it.
</p>

<p 
class="aligncenter"><img src="flywheel.jpg" width="500" height="350" alt="This is the flywheel.">
</p>

<p>
    The damper is a lever that is attached to the flywheel. Remember the erg operates on erg resistance, 
    so the damper controls how much air flows into the flywheel, making it the control of the resistance.
    As you can see in the picture, there are numbers in the flywheel to select the level. The 
    higher this number is, the more air goes into the flywheel which means it takes more work to 
    actually pull the handle towards your torso and "row".
</p>

<p 
class="aligncenter"><img src="damper.jpg" width="500" height="350" alt="The dark blue lever in the flywheel is the damper.">
</p>

<p>Finally, there is the seat, which slides with every rowing stroke you give, so you slide back and 
    forth on the erg.

<h2>
    Why should I row?
</h2>

<p>
    Rowing is a cardio activity, meaning it is good for your endurance and your heart's health. Because it
    is a very taxing activity, you can burn up to 800 calories per hour of rowing (which is more than
    you would generally burn if you are running for one hour!). So, what are the benefits of rowing?
</p>

<ul>
    <li>It helps you stay fit. The <a href="https://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/factsheet_adults/en/">
        World Health Organization recommends</a> that an adult exercises for at least 150 minutes of 
        moderate-intensity or at least 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week. With indoor rowing, you 
        can go at a lower effort for longer times or you can go all out for a more strenous effort</li> 
    <li>While many people believe rowing is an arms workout, it is not. 
        <a href="https://www.concept2.com/indoor-rowers/training/muscles-used">In reality, it uses uses 
        most muscle groups</a>: the large muscles in your legs give you the first push, then your core 
        and back continues the stroke, and it is only at the last stage when you engage your arms to pull 
        the handle to your chest. </li> 
    <li>You don't need to go outside with the virus to do it. You can stay safe at home and even catch up 
        on your <a href="http://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a> watchlist while you safely exercise at home.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
    How do I effectively use an indoor rowing?
</h2>

<p>While indoor rowing is very easy, it is a movement that uses your whole body, so it is important to
    understand the proper technique to perform the execrise without injuring yourself. If you do not 
    follow the right technique, you are at risk of injuring your lower back, ribcabe and shoulders. 
    Rowing without proper technique will also make your workout feel more difficult and will make it
    less effective for your body (you're working harder but doing it wrong--a bad combination!).  
</p>
<p>
    To effectively use an indoor rowing machine, you should follow the steps below: 
</p>
<ol>
    <li>The catch: this is where you start, with your legs bent and your torso closer to 
        the monitor.
    </li>
    <img class=listcenter src="1thecatch.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="1. The catch.">

    <li>The drive: this is when you push yourself back using
        your legs. Your legs end up extended, parallel to the ground.
    </li>
    <img class=listcenter src="2thedrive.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="2. The drive.">

    <li>The finish: here your legs are already extended, but now 
        you have to bring your arms with the handle the closest to your 
        chest.
    </li>

    <img class=listcenter src="3thefinish.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="3. The finish.">
    
    <li>The recovery: here you reposition yourself to go
        back to step one, first your arms get closer to the monitor,
        then your back, finally you bend your legs again so they
        are perpendicular to the ground. 
    </li>
    
    <img class=listcenter src="4therecovery.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="4. The recovery.">
  </ol>
<p>
    You should not be: 
</p>

<ul>
<li>overreaching the front</li>
<li>keeping your shoulders tight</li>
<li>slouching at the finish</li>
<li>leaning back too far at the finish</li>
<li>bending your wrists at the finish</li>
</ul>
